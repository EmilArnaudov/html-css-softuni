                <p>Tim laid out his vision for what would become the web in a document called “Information Management: A
                    Proposal”. Believe it or not, Tim’s initial proposal was not immediately accepted. In fact, his boss
                    at the time, Mike Sendall, noted the words “Vague but exciting” on the cover.</p>

                <p>Tim had written the three fundamental technologies that remain the foundation of today’s web (and
                    which you may have seen appear on parts of your web browser):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>HTML:</span> HyperText Markup Language. The markup (formatting) language for the web.</li>
                    <li><span>URI:</span> Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of “address” that is unique and used to identify to
                        each resource on the web. It is also commonly called a URL.</li>
                    <li><span>HTTP:</span> Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the retrieval of linked resources from across the
                        web.</li>
